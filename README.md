 <p>Your high school has started an after-school computer club and they really need your help! The club is finishing a course on Javascript and the students will have to take a test before completing. The school has therefore asked you to create a website on which students can take the test. They will answer the multiple choice questions on the website, which you'll have created and after submitting their answers, they know what they scored on the website.<p>
